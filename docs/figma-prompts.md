### Prompt A — High-Quality Dark Mode (Mobile-First)
**Goal:** Design a premium, mobile-first B2B wholesale platform in native dark mode called **Inflnce**.

**Aesthetic:** modern, sleek, authoritative; dark grays/off-black with a single bold accent; Inter font; shadcn/ui style components; avoid bubbly AI-generated looks.

**Key Screens:** Login/Apply; Reseller Dashboard; Service Catalog (filters by Category→Platform); Service Details & Ordering (tiered table + order modal); Orders (history table); Admin: Dashboard, Users, Services, Orders.

**Constraints:** Mobile first mockups + responsive desktop variants; clean tables, cards, pill filters; minimal animations (subtle motion, micro-interactions). Prioritize clarity over marketing.

**References:** Mirror the quality and layout language of `inflnce-io.vercel.app` but elevate polish; admin matches public style.

---

### Prompt B — Clone + Admin
**Goal:** Pixel-clone the visual/interaction style of `https://inflnce-io.vercel.app/` for public pages **and** add a matching Admin Dashboard.

**Scope:**
- **Clone:** Landing, Services, Login.
- **Admin (new):** Login; Dashboard (stat cards); Users (table + invite); Services (categories/platforms/tiers CRUD); Orders (status transitions via dropdown).

**Requirements:**
- Strict dark mode; shadcn-like components; mobile-first; responsive desktop layouts; consistent animations; professional, not "social panel".
