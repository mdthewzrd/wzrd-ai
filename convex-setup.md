# ðŸš€ Convex Setup Instructions

Your Convex URL is already configured! Now we need to authenticate and deploy.

## Step 1: Authenticate with Convex

Open a new terminal in this directory and run:

```bash
npx convex login
```

This will open your browser to authenticate. Log in with the same account you used to create the project.

## Step 2: Deploy Your Functions

After logging in, run:

```bash
npx convex deploy
```

This will:
- Connect to your project (precise-echidna-398)
- Upload all the database schema
- Deploy all the functions we created
- Generate TypeScript types

## Step 3: Keep Convex Running (for development)

During development, run:

```bash
npx convex dev
```

This will watch for changes and auto-deploy.

## What You Should See

When successful, you'll see:
```

## Step 4: Restart Your Next.js Server

```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
npm run dev
```
